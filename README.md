## SPOOX

<br>
  
**SPOOX – SPlit lOOp eXpand**

A terminal-integrated, LLM-powered multi-agent system designed to assist directly within the terminal.
Several differently scaled variants have been developed and are accessible through a terminal CLI: spoox-s, spoox-m, and spoox-l. 
The architectures of these agent systems are based on the _spoox_ MAS framework, a generic architectural framework for multi-agent topology and communication design. 
The **spoox-m** variant achieved first place on the [Terminal Bench leaderboard](https://www.tbench.ai/leaderboard/terminal-bench/2.0?models=GPT-5-Mini) for the gpt-5-mini model and is therefore used as the default configuration for the spoox terminal CLI.
